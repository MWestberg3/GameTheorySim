# Optional HW: Game Theory Simulation #
## Set up ##
After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w), the following questions came up:
1. What happens when 3+ birds show up at a resource?
2. What if one hawk and 2+ doves?
3. What happens if 2+ hawks and 1+ dove?
These are my conclusions corresponding to the above questions, as answers were not found in resources available:
1. When 3+ birds show up at a resource, each bird divies up the resources such that if 3 birds arrive at a resource, each bird would get 2/3 of the resource.
2. The hawk gets the same amount, and the doves split the remainder.
3. All die.
## Results ##
### Part 1 ###
#### Dove Simulation ####
I find here that the population of doves levels out to approximately 120 doves when given only 100 locations for food over the course of one year. There are fluctuations of course, but they stay relatively close to 120 total doves.
#### Dove and Hawk ####
